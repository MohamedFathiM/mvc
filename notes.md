# Notes 

## Lazy loading design pattern in PHP

Lazy loading is a software design pattern where the initialization of an object occurs only 
when it is actually needed -- to improve performance.

The opposite of **lazy loading** is so called **eager loading** where the data, resource, and object is created in the time of the initialization.
